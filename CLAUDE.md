## Architecture Overview

### Design Philosophy (MCP)

Following the Shopify Storefront MCP design philosophy:

- **Maximum 3-4 tools** per MCP server (this project: 3 tools)
- **User-intent naming**: Tools named by what users want to do, not technical implementation
- **Unified parameters**: All tools use `query` (required) + `context` (optional) strings only
- **Business value focus**: Every tool solves a real user problem

### Implemented Tools (2/3 Complete)

1. **`search_trains`** - Query train schedules, real-time status, and fares ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
   - Natural language queries like "Tomorrow morning 8am Taipei to Taichung fastest train"
   - Intelligent routing to appropriate TDX APIs (timetables, live boards, fares)
   - **NEW**: Train number direct queries (e.g., "152", "1234ËôüÂàóËªä")
   - **NEW**: Smart completion with intelligent suggestions
   - **NEW**: Real-time live status integration (TrainLiveBoard API)
   - **NEW**: Enhanced visual design with modern emoji system (üü¢üü°üî¥ traffic lights)
   - **NEW**: Delay time adjustment - automatic calculation of adjusted arrival/departure times

2. **`search_station`** - Station discovery and confirmation ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
   - Handle ambiguous station names, provide candidates with confidence scores
   - Support both TRA and Alishan Forest Railway (AFR)
   - Fuzzy matching with confidence scoring
   - Common abbreviations support (ÂåóËªä ‚Üí Ëá∫Âåó)

3. **`plan_trip`** - Trip planning and recommendations ‚è≥ **PLANNED**
   - Provide actionable suggestions based on schedules and real-time data
   - Include backup options and transfer recommendations

### Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ (Google Cloud Run deployment target)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.0+
- **MCP SDK**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- **Transport**: Dual support - STDIO (Claude Desktop) + Streamable HTTP (web/n8n)
- **AI Parser**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite for natural language understanding
- **APIs**: TDX Taiwan Railway APIs (OAuth 2.0 authentication)

### Reference Implementations

1. **tdx-tra-mcp-server/** - Direct TDX API integration with 50+ low-level tools
2. **smart-weather-mcp-server/** - Weather MCP server following user-intent design

## Development Guidelines

### Development Philosophy

#### Core Beliefs

- **Incremental progress over big bangs**: Small changes that compile and pass tests
- **Learning from existing code**: Study and plan before implementing
- **Pragmatic over dogmatic**: Adapt to project reality
- **Clear intent over clever code**: Be boring and obvious

#### Simplicity Means

- Single responsibility per function/class
- Avoid premature abstractions
- No clever tricks - choose the boring solution
- If you need to explain it, it's too complex

### Core Development Principles

#### Speed & Delivery

- **Deploy Fast First**: Remove time constraints, deploy simple features first, iterate quickly
- **Small Batch Development**: Each step must be small and verifiable, avoid large integrations
- **Incremental Value Delivery**: Start with MVP, enhance gradually, each phase operates independently
- **Pragmatism Over Perfection**: "Working" is more important than "perfect", apply 80/20 rule

#### Risk Management

- **Critical Risk First**: Validate most critical parts earliest, confirm technical feasibility first
- **Fail Fast Principle**: Discover non-viable approaches quickly, set time boxes, failure is learning
- **Minimize Assumptions**: Don't assume technology will work, validate every assumption
- **Reversible Design**: Every decision must be rollback-able, keep old versions

#### Validation & Learning

- **Continuous Validation**: Test in actual production environment, not just locally
- **Clear Validation Methods**: Success criteria must be quantifiable, have backup plans
- **Continuous Learning**: Record lessons after each step, document difficult experiences
- **Problems Before Solutions**: Understand "why" before rushing to code

#### Technical Management

- **Observability First**: Add logging from day one, clear error messages
- **Minimize Dependencies**: Use standard library when possible, every dependency is risk
- **Complexity Budget**: Simple systems are easier to maintain
- **Implementation Consistency**: Use same approaches for same problems
- **Hybrid Solutions**: Combine local processing with remote fallbacks
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Context-aware decisions over fixed thresholds
- **Graceful Degradation**: Design to work when dependencies fail
- **Production-Like Testing**: Real usage patterns over engineered test cases
- **Composition over inheritance**: Use dependency injection
- **Interfaces over singletons**: Enable testing and flexibility
- **Singletons via DI when justified**: If a singleton is necessary, create and manage it via the DI/provider layer and expose only through interfaces
- **Explicit over implicit**: Clear data flow and dependencies

### MCP Design Philosophy

#### Core Design Principles

1. **User-Centric Tool Design**
   - Tool names MUST reflect user intent, NOT technical implementation
   - ‚úÖ Good: `search_trains`, `search_station`, `plan_trip`
   - ‚ùå Bad: `get_timetable_api`, `call_tdx_endpoint`, `fetch_data`

2. **Minimal Tool Count**
   - Maximum 3-4 tools per MCP server
   - Each tool must have clear business value
   - Avoid technical function splitting

3. **Unified Parameter Structure**
   - ALL tools MUST use identical parameters:

     ```json
     {
       "query": "natural language user request",
       "context": "optional preferences and context"
     }
     ```

   - No structured parameters like `stationId`, `date`, `trainType` separately

4. **Business Value Orientation**
   - Every tool must solve a real user problem
   - Include actionable recommendations in responses
   - Think: "What should the user do next?"

5. **Tool Collaboration Design**
   - Tools must work together in logical user journeys:

     ```text
     User Need ‚Üí Tool 1 (Discovery) ‚Üí Tool 2 (Action) ‚Üí Tool 3 (Confirmation)
     ```

   - Example: `search_station` ‚Üí `search_trains` ‚Üí `plan_trip`

#### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ‚ùå Technical function splitting (separate tools for each API)
- ‚ùå Parameter structure inconsistency
- ‚ùå Implementation-focused naming
- ‚ùå Data-only responses without guidance

### Response Format

- **Dual-format output**: Prefer responses that include both machine-readable structure (e.g., compact JSON as text) and a concise human-readable summary. Keep user-facing text actionable.

### Git Commit Standards

#### Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Subject Line Rules

- Use imperative verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove)
- Keep under 50 characters
- Do not end with period
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

#### Body Guidelines

- Leave blank line after subject
- Explain "why" this change was made, not just "what"
- Keep lines under 72 characters
- List important changes

#### Examples

```text
feat(tools): add search_station tool with fuzzy matching

- Implement station name disambiguation
- Add confidence scoring for matches
- Support both TRA and AFR stations

Closes #42
```

```text
fix(auth): handle TDX token expiration correctly

- Check token expiry before API calls
- Implement automatic token refresh
- Add retry logic for 401 responses
```

## Development Process

### Planning & Staging

Break complex work into 3-5 stages. Document in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:

```markdown
## Stage N: [Name]
**Goal**: [Specific deliverable]
**Success Criteria**: [Testable outcomes]
**Tests**: [Specific test cases]
**Status**: [Not Started|In Progress|Complete]
```

- Update status as you progress
- Remove file when all stages are done

### Implementation Flow

1. **Understand** - Study existing patterns in codebase
2. **Test** - Write test first (red)
3. **Implement** - Minimal code to pass (green)
4. **Refactor** - Clean up with tests passing
5. **Commit** - With clear message linking to plan

### When Stuck (After 3 Attempts)

**CRITICAL**: Maximum 3 attempts per issue, then STOP.

1. **Document what failed**:
   - What you tried
   - Specific error messages
   - Why you think it failed

2. **Research alternatives**:
   - Find 2-3 similar implementations
   - Note different approaches used

3. **Question fundamentals**:
   - Is this the right abstraction level?
   - Can this be split into smaller problems?
   - Is there a simpler approach entirely?

4. **Try different angle**:
   - Different library/framework feature?
   - Different architectural pattern?
   - Remove abstraction instead of adding?

## Implementation Plan

Based on `prd.md` and `spec.md`:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

- Set up TypeScript project structure
- Implement MCP server base with dual transport (STDIO + HTTP)
- Integrate TDX OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Set up Secret Manager for credentials

### Phase 2: Station Search Tool

- Consider real-time delays and transfer options
- Provide multiple route options (fastest/cheapest/fewest transfers)

### Phase 5: Production Deployment

- Docker containerization
- Google Cloud Run deployment
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Performance optimization and caching
- Health check endpoint: expose `/health` with basic status and mode

## Key Technical Considerations

### TDX API Integration

- OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow

- Include context for debugging
- Handle errors at appropriate level
- Never silently swallow exceptions

### Performance Targets

- Average response time < 1.5 seconds
- AI parsing time < 500ms
- Cache hit rate ‚â• 60% for common queries
- Cold start time < 800ms for Cloud Run

## Implementation Best Practices

### When Starting Development

1. **Review Principles First**: Check development principles before each phase
2. **Validate Early**: Confirm technical feasibility with minimal code
3. **Document Immediately**: Record decisions and learnings in real-time
4. **Test in Production-Like Environment**: Use actual TDX APIs early
5. **Learn from Codebase**: Find 3 similar features and identify patterns
6. **Use Existing Tools**: Don't introduce new tools without justification

### Priority Order (When Principles Conflict)

1. **Speed & Delivery** - Rapidly validate ideas
2. **Risk Management** - Avoid big disasters
3. **Validation & Learning** - Ensure doing the right thing
4. **Other Principles** - Optimize based on above three

### Quality Gates

- Validate (build + tests + lint) must pass before every commit

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No linter/formatter warnings
- [ ] Commit messages are clear
- [ ] Implementation matches plan
- [ ] No TODOs without issue numbers
- [ ] Every commit compiles successfully
- [ ] All existing tests pass

#### Test Guidelines

- Test behavior, not implementation
- One assertion per test when possible
- Clear test names describing scenario
- Use existing test utilities/helpers
- Tests should be deterministic
- Never disable tests, fix them

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] All tools use identical `query` + `context` parameters
- [ ] Tool names reflect user intent, not technical implementation
- [ ] Maximum 3 tools total
- [ ] Each tool has clear business value
- [ ] Tools work together in logical user journeys
- [ ] Responses include actionable recommendations
- [ ] No technical jargon in user-facing descriptions
- [ ] Consistent error handling across all tools
- [ ] Natural language query support in all tools

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-engineering**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed
2. **Ignoring Rate Limits**: TDX has 50 req/s limit - implement proper throttling
3. **Hardcoding Values**: Use configuration for all environment-specific values
4. **Poor Error Messages**: Always provide actionable suggestions to users
5. **Skipping Integration Tests**: Unit tests pass but real APIs behave differently
6. **Using console.log in MCP Servers**: NEVER use `console.log` in MCP servers - it corrupts the JSON-RPC protocol on stdout. Always use `console.error` for debugging output
7. **Missing .js Extensions**: In ES modules, always include `.js` extensions in relative imports (e.g., `import { Parser } from './parser.js'`)
8. **Third-party Dependencies Stdout Pollution**: Some packages like `dotenv` may output to stdout. In MCP servers, avoid packages that write to stdout or configure them to be silent

### Documentation to Maintain

- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: Current development stages and progress
- **decisions.md**: Record architectural decisions and rationale
- **lessons-learned.md**: Document challenges and solutions
- **troubleshooting.md**: Common issues and fixes
- **api-coverage.md**: Track which TDX APIs are integrated

### Decision Framework

When multiple valid approaches exist, choose based on:

1. **Testability** - Can I easily test this?
2. **Readability** - Will someone understand this in 6 months?
3. **Consistency** - Does this match project patterns?
4. **Simplicity** - Is this the simplest solution that works?
5. **Reversibility** - How hard to change later?

### GitHub Issue Workflow

When fixing a GitHub issue:

1. **Create a new branch** for the issue (e.g., `fix/issue-123` or `feat/issue-456`)
2. **Find the root cause first** - Understand the problem before implementing a solution
3. **Fix and test the solution** - Ensure the fix works and doesn't break existing functionality
4. **Commit changes at each step** - Make incremental commits with clear messages
5. **Ask for verification** - Request user to verify the fix before considering it complete
6. **Only push when explicitly requested** - Never push to remote unless user asks
7. **Only create PR when explicitly requested** - Never create pull requests unless user asks

### Implementation Workflow

When implementing new features or functionality:

1. **Understand requirements first** - Clarify what needs to be built before starting
2. **Study existing patterns** - Look at similar implementations in the codebase
3. **Use TodoWrite tool** - Create a task list for complex implementations (3+ steps)
4. **Start with minimal working version** - Get basic functionality working first
5. **Iterate and enhance** - Add features incrementally, test each addition
6. **Commit frequently** - Make commits after each working increment
7. **Run tests and linters** - Execute `npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run lint` if available
8. **Ask for feedback** - Request user verification at key milestones
9. **Document decisions** - Update relevant docs if making architectural choices
10. **Only push/PR when requested** - Never push or create PRs unless explicitly asked

### Important Reminders

**NEVER**:

- Use `--no-verify` to bypass commit hooks
- Disable tests instead of fixing them
- Commit code that doesn't compile
- Make assumptions - verify with existing code
- Use `console.log` in MCP servers (breaks JSON-RPC protocol)
- Import packages that output to stdout in MCP servers (e.g., dotenv)
- Push to remote unless explicitly requested by user

**ALWAYS**:

- Commit working code incrementally
- Update plan documentation as you go
- Learn from existing implementations
- Stop after 3 failed attempts and reassess
- Run formatters/linters before committing
- Self-review changes before pushing
- Use `console.error` for debugging in MCP servers (not `console.log`)
- Include `.js` extensions in ES module imports
- Verify third-party packages don't output to stdout in MCP servers
- Create a new branch when working on GitHub issues
